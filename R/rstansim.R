#' rstansim: running simulation studies with Stan
#'
#' rstansim provides a set of helper functions and utilities to make it easier
#' to setup, run, analyse, and manage simulation studies in R that use
#' Stan for estimating Bayesian models.
#'
#' The package addresses three aspects of running a simulation study:
#'
#' \itemize{
#' \item Data simulation [currently not covered].
#' \item Model fitting and capture of relevant data.
#' \item Management of simulation results.
#' }
