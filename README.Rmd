Overview
--------

*PACKAGE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND UNLIKELY TO WORK FOR YOU. SORRY*

`rstansim` provides a set of helper and utility functions to simplify running simulation studies using R and [stan](http://mc-stan.org/). The package addresses three aspects of running a simulation study:

* Data simulation. [currently not covered]
* Model fitting and capture of relevant data.
* Management of simulation results.

All simulation data is output in a tidy format, for ease of interaction with tidyverse packages for analysis and visualisation. Additionally reproducability information such as seeds, initial values, and data used, are stored alongside the data. 



Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
